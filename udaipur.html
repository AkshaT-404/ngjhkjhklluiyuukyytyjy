        <p class="Introduction-1">Often referred to as the 'Venice of the East', the city of lakes Udaipur is located
            around azure water lakes and is hemmed in by lush green hills of Aravallis. The famous Lake Palace, located
            in the middle of Lake Pichola is one of the most beautiful sights of Udaipur. It is also home to Jaisamand
            Lake, claimed to be the second largest man-made sweet water lake in Asia. The beautiful City Palace and
            Sajjangarh (Monsoon Palace) add to the architectural beauty and grandeur of the city. The city is also known
            for its profusion of zinc and marble. Solar observatory in Lake Fateh Sagar is the only observatory in India
            located on an island and has been made on the pattern of Big Bear Lake in Southern California. The ten-day
            Shilpgram Festival which starts from 21 Dec to 30 Dec pulls in a large number of people interested in arts
            and crafts.

            Udaipur was founded in 1553 by Maharana Udai Singh II as the new capital of Mewar Kingdom. It is located in
            the fertile, circular Girwa Valley to the southwest of Nagda, which was the first capital of Mewar.

        <p class="Introduction-9">Maharana Udai Singh II established Udaipur in 1559 on the Banas River's lush Girwa
            Valley, southwest of Nagda. The city was chosen to serve as the Mewar kingdom's new capital. Ayad, a wealthy
            commercial town that had served as Mewar's capital from the 10th to the 12th century, was already present in
            this region. As a result, Chittaud kings were already familiar with the Girwa region and frequently
            relocated there whenever an enemy onslaught threatened the nearby tableland of Chittaurgarh. After the
            development of artillery warfare in the 16th century, Rana Udai Singh II made the decision, while in exile
            in Kumbhalgarh, to relocate his capital to a more secure site. Ayad was prone to flooding, so he picked the
            ridge east of Pichola Lake to establish his new capital city. While hunting in the Aravalli Range foothills,
            he stumbled into a hermit. According to the legend, the hermit gave the king his blessing and instructed him
            to erect a palace there, telling him that it would be well-defended. On the spot, Udai Singh II subsequently
            built a house. Chittor was subdued by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in November 1567. Rana Udai Singh constructed
            a six-kilometer city wall with seven gates, including Surajpole, Chandpole, Udiapole, Hathipole, Ambapole,
            Brahmpole, Delhi Gate, and Kishanpole, to defend his domain from invasion. The ancient city or walled city
            still refers to the territory enclosed by these walls and gates.
